# Overview

This proect is suitable for new-comers to machine learning and have great popularity in the machine learning community. Here I choose to build this neural network from scratch, with only basic libraries like numpy and Matplotlib used. 

Despite its seemingly simpkicity, I've encountered quite a lot of obstacles during my programming and training. Following is how I manage to make it work, with an accuracy of over
