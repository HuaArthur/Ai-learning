# Learning_Ai
## Overview

This is a repository tha records my journey to study machine learning.

Recent years, development in Ai has rocketed, and the public is amazed by what it can achieve now. I've always been deeply fascinated by the mechanism of computers and how simple circuits can "think" through programming and training. So, I embark on a journey to explore the world of AI

In order to have a firm foundation of machine learning, there are generally three topics that need to be learned.They are the foundation in Maths, Python's coding skills, and finally the principle of machin learning. Luckily, I've already been equipped with the required skills in Maths ,such as linear algebra and calculus, so it shouldn't be a problem.

My schedule is to learning the basic Python libraries required for machine learning in just a couple of days, and then put all my efforts into enhancing my machine learning skills.

## Python library

There are three libraries I need to learn(libraries like pytorch isn't included, they are included in the next section)

  * Numpy: I would say this is the most useful and fundamental library used in machine learning, as it greatly improves the efficiency of working with arrays and metrices, which is commonly used in machine learning

  * Panda: This library allows you to process data faster and more convenient. Data collection is a big part in machine learning.

  * Matplotlib: With this library, you can draw wonderful diagrams to visualize your received data or your training result. Visualization is a big deal in machine learning projects.

## Machine Learning Basics

# Supervised Learning

After I 've learned the basics of these libraries above, I move on to search for good resorces in machine learning on the internet and landed on the decision to take a course by Adrew Ng on Coursera, named "Machine Learning Specializaion". It contains 3 individual courses, and I pay most of my attention on the first one, which is about supervised learning, specifically regression and classification.
