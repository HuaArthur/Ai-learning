# Learning_Ai

## Overview

This is a repository that records my journey into studying machine learning.

In recent years, development in AI has skyrocketed, and the public is awed by what it can achieve. I've always been deeply fascinated by the mechanisms of computers and how simple circuits can seemingly "think" through programming and training. Therefore, I embark on a journey to explore the world of AI.

To establish a firm foundation in machine learning, there are generally three key topics to learn: mathematics fundamentals, Python coding skills, and finally, the principles of machine learning. Luckily, I'm already equipped with the necessary math skills, such as linear algebra and calculus, so that shouldn't be a problem.

My plan is to learn the basic Python libraries required for machine learning in just a couple of days and then devote all my efforts to enhancing my machine learning skills.

## Python Libraries

There are three core libraries I need to learn (libraries like PyTorch aren't included; they'll be covered in the next section).

* NumPy: This is arguably the most useful and fundamental library used in machine learning. It significantly improves the efficiency of working with arrays and matrices, which are commonly used in machine learning.

* Pandas: This library allows you to process data faster and more conveniently. Data collection is a big part of machine learning.

* Matplotlib: With this library, you can create compelling visualizations to represent your data or training results. Visualization is crucial for machine learning projects.

* update--opencv:a powerful tool to process images and videos.

## Machine Learning Basics


  After learning the basics of these libraries, I explored online resources for machine learning and decided   to take a course by Andrew Ng on Coursera, named "Machine Learning Specialization." It contains three   
  individual courses, and I focused most of my attention on the first one, which covers supervised learning,   specifically regression and classification.

## Deep Learning

Deep learning is essentially a subdomain of supervised learning, but I list it separately because it's both the most challenging and the most intriguing part I've encountered. Initially, I decided to bypass the core concepts and jump straight into using PyTorch for deep learning. However, without a foundation in the underlying principles, I couldn't effectively utilize those libraries. As a result, I enrolled in a series of four courses on Coursera, named "Deep Learning Specialization."

* Project1--Cat Recognition

  After completing my first course, I develop a project to test my deep learning skills, and more     
  importantly, my data collection and processing skills. I name the project "Cat Recognition". During my 
  project, I proceed to learn another labrary--opencv.
